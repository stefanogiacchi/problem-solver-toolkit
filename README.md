# Problem Solver Toolkit  
### Real-World Utilities for Enterprise Systems  
**.NET 8 • Clean Architecture • CQRS • HTTP Clients • Validation • Diagnostics**

The **Problem Solver Toolkit** is a curated collection of utilities, helpers, extensions and patterns  
designed for **real-world enterprise development**.

These are components I rely on when dealing with:
- high-complexity systems
- legacy modernization
- distributed architectures
- API integrations
- performance bottlenecks
- debugging production issues
- delivery acceleration

This repository captures the **core tools that consistently solve problems** across .NET enterprise projects.
